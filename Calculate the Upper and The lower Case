# define the function to count the number of upper and lower case letters
def count_case(string):
  # initialize the counters for upper and lower case letters
  upper_count = 0
  lower_count = 0
  
  # loop through the characters in the string
  for char in string:
    # if the character is uppercase, increment the upper count
    if char.isupper():
      upper_count += 1
    # if the character is lowercase, increment the lower count
    elif char.islower():
      lower_count += 1
      
  # return the count of upper and lower case letters
  return upper_count, lower_count

# test the function with the sample string
string = 'The quick Brow Fox'
upper_count, lower_count = count_case(string)

# print the results
print("No. of Upper case characters:", upper_count)
print("No. of Lower case characters:", lower_count)

The output of this program will be
No. of Upper case characters: 3
No. of Lower case characters: 12
