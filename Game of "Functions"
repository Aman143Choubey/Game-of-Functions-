# define the function to sum the numbers in the list
def sum_numbers(numbers):
  # initialize the sum to 0
  total = 0
  
  # loop through the numbers in the list
  for num in numbers:
    # add the current number to the total
    total += num
    
  # return the total
  return total

# test the function with the sample list
numbers = (8, 2, 3, 0, 7)
result = sum_numbers(numbers)

# print the result
print(result)
